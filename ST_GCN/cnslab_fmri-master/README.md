This project was done in the Computational Neuroscience Lab (CNS Lab) at Stanford. The main goal of the project is to predict sex and age from resting state functional MRI (f-MRI) scans using a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network.

This is a simplified version of the ST-GCN module: https://github.com/yysijie/st-gcn

The previous version of this module implementation for f-MRI scans can be found at https://github.com/ericksiavichay/cs230-final-project

**DATA USAGE**

For HCP, the the data "Resting State fMRI 1 Preprocessed" was downloaded from https://db.humanconnectome.org/. The GIFTI images were then parcellated using https://balsa.wustl.edu/QnXj

Here are the final processed BOLD signal files: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c4UYvp089KwqAllAHdHMHGjq8y5x882D/view.

If you need the NCANDA data, you should directly contact last author Dr. Kilian Pohl (kilian.pohl@stanford.edu) for data usage.
